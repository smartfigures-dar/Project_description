# Objectives:

- Collect wishes, taking preprints as an idea catalyst

--

- Get a hands-on on the Result gallery tool

???

Participative start: either ask people to stand up and move left/right as answers to the questions, or (if the room is too small for that) get people to stand up/sit as answers to the questions.

- who has heard of bioarchiv?

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
options(htmltools.dir.version = FALSE)
```

???

- who knows this (bioarchiv logo visible)
- who reads "article" there?
- who wrote pre-published an article there?

Researcher's responses:

```{r , echo=FALSE}

.pull-right[
ASAPbio responses:

-  (1) Speed up science
-  (4) Freely available (not always ‘open’), **shared**
-  (3) Give authors precedence (**priority claim**)
-  (2) Allow pre-publication peer review and 
**feedback**, making ‘better’ articles



-  (5) Surface data that may not survive review

BUT
-  Risk of incorrect information or 
    conclusions that could harm individual or 
    population health
