# Objectives:

- Collecting wishes, taking preprints as an idea catalyst

--

- Discuss research figures using the Result gallery tool

???

Participative start: either ask people to stand up and move left/right as answers to the questions, or (if the room is too small for that) get people to stand up/sit as answers to the questions.

- who has heard of bioarchiv?

```

???

- who knows this (bioarchiv logo visible)
- who reads "article" there?
- who wrote pre-published an article there?
